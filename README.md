## Overview

Any work that seems easy will have a learning curve that helps grow forward and this challenge is also not a little on that perspective. It's good to step in to try if not done that before even the slightest changes that work have.

## My process

- made semantic HTML structure
- started with Mobile-first workflow
- commented out the useful instructions where confusion may arise in the future
- Used flexbox to display page in full height and center the element

### Built with

- HTML
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
  - Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Each step of practice give learning forward, in this challenge especially would like to mention making an element center with the flexbox. Even though I've done it with the margin auto method earlier I've come to know the flexbox give a more cutting edge method to do it perfectly that may be less error-prone or no error at all. Also noted is that flexbox is easy when center an element but setting a full screen with the help of it was a little trickier.

### Continued development

Knowing CSS methodologies will be a plus moving forward, not just limit on that Sass or Less and many other. 

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - used to make the full page display.
